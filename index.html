    (If unfamilier with the rules of chess, you might want to check out the web site
    <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~jedwards/cif/intro.html" target="_blank">Chess is
        Fun</a>* by Jon Edwards, United States Correspondence Chess Champion.)
    <p>
        This HTML based game allows two players to compete against each other in the age
        old game of chess. Each player will take turns in this game. First, all pieces are
        set up on the board. Each player than enters their name and is assigned a color
        (black or white). At this point, the game begins and the person playing the white
        pieces moves first. After they have had a chance to move, their opponent will then
        have their chance to move. After the opponent has had their chance to move, play
        cycles back to the first person. The game continues like this until one of the two
        players succeeds in capturing the other players king or a stalemate is reached.
        This game will only allow for legitimate chess moves. At this time castling is not
        supported. Good luck!
