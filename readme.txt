This file contains information on the use of XML in my chessgame.js JavaScript file
Alert will appear on game page on startup that when pressed runs through function getXML that meets project guidelines. Get XML is at very end of chessgame.js.
More detail if needed...
I created a file called XMLdata.XML that has a series of chess positions with a name attribute and 3 data references. I load the data from the file as a list and then I iterate through the list getting each item name, row, column and image source info for piece style and store each item in its own list named listName, listRow, listColumn, and listDisplay.
I than iterate through the length of listName (all four list have the same length), placing each value in my list of chess positions (in these case 11 pieces are placed in the list).  I than call my writeboard() function created way back at the beginning of the system (second assignment I think) and that function uses the list to draw out the board with pieces setup the way I want.   I used a classic chess endgame Fischer-Spassky, Reykjavik, 1972, Game 6 (for whatever that’s worth).
I followed all assignment guidelines: XML document or JSON file with game data, Gets data from XML document, Uses XMLHttpRequest, Displays data from XML document or JSON file on game page or game description page, Includes readme.txt file that explains how XML or JSON is used. After board is setup in classic endgame position, you can enter your player’s names and pick a color and it will reset the board to starting position.  Not quite ready for a game to begin but will be by final project submission.
Thanks
